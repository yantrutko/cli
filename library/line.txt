    return:
        0: no writing to poiner_for_digits;
        1: success;
    mode:
        1: success only if full line is a number without misstakes;
        2: translate alphabetic to numeric, stops when addiction symbol cannot become part of an already translated number and write result to pointer_for_digits, return success even if first symbol is an alphabetic and pointer_for_digits will be 0.0;
